## Purpose
OpenVAS (now part of Greenbone Vulnerability Management - GVM) is a full-featured vulnerability scanner that runs authenticated and unauthenticated scans, matches CVEs, and produces detailed reports for remediation.

## Scenarios
- CTF: On lab networks you control, run OpenVAS to find known vulnerable services and CVEs you can exploit for practice.  
- Real world: Comprehensive vulnerability assessment for servers and networks — ideal for scheduled scans and compliance checks.

## All needed info to run
- OpenVAS/GVM usually runs as a service (server + web UI). Installation on Kali: `gvm` packages or use `apt` (package names change frequently). Follow official Greenbone/GVM install docs for latest steps.  
- Web GUI (Greenbone Security Assistant) typically runs on `https://localhost:9392` after setup.  
- Requires:
  - Proper installation & initial setup (feed update — vulnerability signatures).  
  - For authenticated scans: credentials (SSH, SMB, Windows creds) or agent setup.  
  - Network/firewall access to target hosts.  
- Typical workflow:
  1. Update vulnerability feeds (takes time): `gvm-feed-update` or via GUI.  
  2. Create target (IP or range) and scan config (full, discovery-only, etc.).  
  3. Launch scan and monitor progress.  
  4. Export reports (PDF, CSV, XML).

## Example commands & outputs
```bash
# Example (service-style) — check status
$ sudo systemctl status gvm
# Output snippet:
# ● gvm.service - Greenbone Vulnerability Manager
#    Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/gvm.service; enabled)
#    Active: active (running) since ...

# Start feed update (may differ by install)
$ sudo gvm-feed-update
# Output snippet:
# Updating NVTs, CERT, SCAP databases...
# Feed update finished.

# Using the web UI:
# 1. Open https://localhost:9392
# 2. Login with admin credentials
# 3. Create Target -> Create Task -> Start Task
# Scan results (GUI) show severity, CVE IDs, and remediation steps.
```

!!! note "OpenVAS / GVM Basics"

	- OpenVAS/GVM setup can be complex and feed updates take time (GBs). Be patient.  
	- Use authenticated scans (with valid creds) for best coverage; unauthenticated scans miss host-level issues.  
	- Installation steps/command names may vary by distro and GVM version — consult Greenbone docs.  
	- Scans are noisy; get permission and schedule during low-impact windows in production.
