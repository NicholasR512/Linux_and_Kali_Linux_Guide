## Purpose
Lynis is an automated security auditing tool for Linux/Unix systems. It scans system configuration, installed software, user accounts, and common security settings to produce hardening suggestions and warnings.

## Scenarios
- CTF (beginner-friendly): Quick health check of a captured VM to find weak settings (world-writable files, weak SSH configs) that might help escalate.  
- Real world: Baseline security audit for a server before handover or during a pentest reconnaissance phase to find misconfigurations and missing patches.

## All needed info to run
- Installed from package manager or git (`apt install lynis` on Kali or `git clone https://github.com/CISOfy/lynis.git`).  
- Prefer running as root to get full checks: `sudo lynis audit system`.  
- Results saved to `/var/log/lynis.log` and reports in `/var/log/lynis-report.dat` (paths printed after a run).  
- Main modes:
  - `lynis audit system` → full system audit
  - `lynis show plugins` → show installed plugins
  - `lynis update info` → update data files (signature/db)
- Can be scheduled via cron for regular checks.

## Example commands & outputs
```bash
# Run a full system audit (recommended with sudo)
$ sudo lynis audit system
# Sample output snippet:
# [INFO]  : Starting Lynis 3.0.0
# [OK]    : Checking operating system and hardware
# [WARNING]: SSH config: PermitRootLogin is enabled (insecure)
# [INFO]  : Hardening index : 65 [# of suggestions: 17]
# Report saved to /var/log/lynis.log
# Summary saved to /var/log/lynis-report.dat

# Show available tests
$ lynis show tests
# Prints list of test categories (authentication, logging, network, etc.)

# Update Lynis data (if applicable)
$ sudo lynis update info
# Updates local plugins and tests database
```

!!! note "Lynis Basics"  
	- Run Lynis as **root** for the most complete checks. Non-root runs are limited.  
	- The **hardening index** is a quick metric (higher = better). Use it to track progress across runs.  
	- Read `/var/log/lynis.log` for full details and recommendations.  
	- Lynis is an auditing tool — it reports issues; fixes must be manual and tested.
