## Purpose
Searchsploit is a command-line tool to search Exploit-DB offline. It lets you quickly find local exploit proof-of-concepts for known software vulnerabilities.

## Scenarios
- CTF: Search for exploits of a service/version banner you discover during enumeration.  
- Real world: Map discovered software versions against known vulnerabilities for testing.

## All needed info to run
- Installed with `exploitdb` package on Kali. Database stored locally.  
- Basic syntax: `searchsploit <keyword>`.  
- Options:
  - `-m <id>` → mirror (copy) exploit to current dir  
  - `-x <id>` → open exploit in editor  
  - `-p` → show full exploit path  
  - `-u` → update database  
- Database path: `/usr/share/exploitdb/`.

## Example commands & outputs
```bash
# Search for vsftpd exploits
$ searchsploit vsftpd 2.3.4
# Output:
# ----------------------------------------------
# Exploit Title                       | Path
# vsftpd 2.3.4 - Backdoor Command Exe | unix/remote/17491.rb

# Copy exploit locally
$ searchsploit -m 17491
# Output: Exploit copied to ./17491.rb

# Open exploit in editor
$ searchsploit -x 17491
```

!!! note "Searchsploit Basics"
	- Use `searchsploit <keyword>` with service name/version from nmap or banners.
	- Use `-m` to copy exploit locally so you don’t edit originals.
	- Update regularly with `searchsploit -u`.
	- Not every exploit works out-of-the-box — read and adapt code before running.
