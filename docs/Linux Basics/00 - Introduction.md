## Purpose
The linux command line and other command lines and terminals can be used for a variety of things. The command line gives you the opportunity to search through directories, select specific files, run scripts, and a whole lot more all with just using commands. The command line allows for tasks to be executed quickly if you know what you're doing.

### Example
```
──(nick㉿kali)-[~]
└─$
```
This is my Kali Linux default command line where I can enter a command after the *$*. The *~* shows that the command will run in my home directory.
