## Purpose
Thank you so much for choosing my free beginner Linux/Kali/Capture the Flag guide! My main goals for this project are to educate beginners about the Linux command line and the basic Kali Linux tools along with having all of your commands in one place with explanations [[Kali Tools]] [[Linux Basics]]. If you find this useful at all please leave a [[#review |review]]! It really means a lot <3

## Recommendation
My recommendation for any beginners is to start off with 01-07 of the linux basics because these aren't only command line necessities useful for capture the flags: they are also useful for your everyday lives on your computer. After that, I would go through and learn about all of the Kali tools. These will be useful for capture the flags. To start on CTFs I would use TryHackMe and your own virtual machine. TryHackMe has a lot of really great free labs. I currently have a Macbook Air and my free Kali Linux virtual machine using VMware runs great. It also simulates a real penetration testing environment. 

## Who am I?
I am currently a senior in high school. I recently found an interest in the cybersecurity and penetration testing field, and it is something I'll likely pursue during and after college. This was originally for me just to keep notes of things I was learning for capture the flags on TryHackMe. My first capture the flag fried me because I had no experience or knowledge. I'm hoping this resource helps some people either learn or help remember certain commands. If you have any questions on getting your own virtual machine to started or any other general questions please feel free to email me.
